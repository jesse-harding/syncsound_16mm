***PRINTING***

step 1: open Processing sketch syncsound_16mm.pde

step 2: make sure you have the minim and sound libraries downloaded and added to your Processing folder

step 3: go to the userInputs tab and verify settings such as loop, syncSound, printer dpi, output filename, and filename of audio to be used.

	[PRECAUTION: AUDIO USED SHOULD BE 15.8333333 SECONDS LONG AND MUST HAVE A SAMPLE RATE OF 44100HZ]

step 4: place your 374 frames (at 24fps) of moving image (ideally formatted to 242X177) in the folder named "frames" inside of the data folder

step 5: run Processing sketch (you may need to expand the amount of memory available to Processing via the preferences menu, depending on length of composition)

step 6: open the outputted tiff file and adjust dpi (WITHOUT RESAMPLING) to your printer's resolution (dpi)

step 7: clean transparency sheet of dust and print at highest quality



***LASER CUTTING***

step 1: focus laser cutter using 2 sheets of paper

step 2: test laser cutter power and speed on a transparency sheet for complete cut with minimal melting (example: on epilog mini 60 watt machine, 100 speed, 10 power was my vector setting)

step 3: place a sheet of paper in the laser cutter and tape down its edges

step 4a: load filmstock_alignment.ai and cut at the settings determined in step 2

step 4b: you may need to shift the x,y location of the print origin to avoid the ruler guides; try not to go beyond half an inch in either dimension

step 5: remove the center piece that has been cut out of the paper

step 6: place printed transparency sheet in the laser cutter aligning to the perforations in each corner as well as to the marks on the left side of the printed image

step 7: tape transparency sheet in place, avoiding tape in the area to be cut

step 8: load filmstock_cut.ai and cut at the settings determined in step 2 (observing offsets as determined in step 4b)

step 9: if the numerals printed on the film are illegible, pay attention to the order of the printed sections of film stock.


***SPLICING***

step 1: align perforations in sequential segments of printed film stock noting the numeral in the top left of each segment (the right end of segment 1 should be attached to the left end of segment 2 and so on)

step ?: 3d print splicer????

step 2: use superglue (sparingly) to splice the segments into a continuous piece of film

step 3: load film into projector (carefully, as acetate is less durable than standard film) and enjoy!
